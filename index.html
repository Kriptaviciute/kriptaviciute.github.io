		<p>There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity. 
		Certain numbers were the same way and certain dates and these with the names of the places were all you could say 
		and have them mean anything. Abstract words such as glory, honor, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete 
		names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers, the numbers of regiments and the dates.<br />
